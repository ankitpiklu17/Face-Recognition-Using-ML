# Face-Recognition-Using-ML
This study introduces a face recognition system for student identification, utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and a classifier to achieve accurate and reliable recognition.
The development process began with the collection of a diverse dataset of student facial images, ensuring representation of various facial features and environmental conditions. Preprocessing techniques were applied to standardize the images, which included resizing, normalization, and alignment of facial landmarks. These steps were crucial in reducing variations caused by lighting, pose, and expressions, thereby improving the consistency and quality of the data.

After dimensionality reduction, a classifier was trained on the reduced feature set. We evaluated various classifiers, including Support Vector Machines (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), to determine the most effective model for our system. The chosen classifier was then integrated into the final face recognition system, providing the foundation for student identification.

The implemented system demonstrated robust and accurate performance in identifying students, proving its effectiveness in real-world applications. Its ability to accurately recognize students makes it a valuable tool for automated attendance monitoring and enhancing campus security measures.
